# my-scikit-tools

Being tired of defining the same lines of code every time that I use specific things,
I decided to implement these in this package, so that I just need to 
import the particular tools that I need.

Up to now, the tools implemented are:

  - A module for principal component regression, which include also different regularisation terms.
  - A stratifiedKFold object for regression.
  - A module for connectivity-based predictive modelling.

Under continuously development.

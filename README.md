# my-scikit-tools

Being tired of defining the same lines of code every time that I use specific things,
I decided to implement these in this package, so that I just need to 
import the particular tools that I need.

Under development

# How to install

```
git clone https://github.com/jrasero/my-scikit-tools.git
cd my-scikit-tools
pip install -U .
```
